This script logs you in and out of kol on kolmafia to try keep you on a lag free server.

To see the settings, use `prefref antilag_`

You can configure how many latencies to cache, what to fail on, if the fail should throw an abort, etc.

Each relog takes about 30 seconds at least, and the first time you run this will require 5 relogs to make sure the dataset is filled in.
Default is 15min to see if you're on the best server or not.
